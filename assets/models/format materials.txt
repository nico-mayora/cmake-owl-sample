material_id specularity refraction_index
material_id -> name of the material (string)
specularity -> float 0..1 [0: fuzzy, 1: perfect mirror]
refraction_index -> float how much light is distorted

we currently only support ONE of the two.
if both are set, specularity takes precedence.

to set material_id, load the model into blender and set that name as the material's name.

Example:
mirror 1.0 0.0
glass 0.0 1.0
